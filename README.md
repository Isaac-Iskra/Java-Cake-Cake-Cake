This is an exercise to create a Cake superclass with wedding cake and bakery subclass

In the code, Cake is the superclass which has two fields flavor and price. It also has a default constructor that sets the default values for these fields and getter and setter methods for both fields.

Bakery is a subclass of Cake and does not add any additional functionality.

BirthdayCake is another subclass of Cake that has an additional field candles. It overrides the getFlavor() method to return "chocolate" as the default flavor and has a default constructor that sets the default values for flavor and candles fields.

WeddingCake is a third subclass of Cake that has an additional field tiers. It also overrides the getFlavor() method to return "almond" as the default flavor and has a default constructor that sets the default values for flavor and tiers fields.
